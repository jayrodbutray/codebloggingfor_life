# codebloggingfor_life

## From scratch, I was to develop an online coders blog by using the MVC techniques known as Model, View, and Controllers. With the help of the handlebars templates, the site would allow users to login in order to create their own personal blog site that would render their blogs to the homepage and other users could see and be able to comment on each others blogs.

### I was able to utilize past assignments and classroom assignments that featured specific code needed to complete routes and be added upon to adjust to this specific assignment. I used extensive help from Robbert, who has always set aside time to share his knowledge and was able ask questions that allowed me to understand better the concepts I was trying to apply. I also utilized one tutor session to help me understand the route processes.
